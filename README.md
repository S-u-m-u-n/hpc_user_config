# HPC user config
My dotfiles for HPC clusters. They make navigating around in a terminal via ssh more comfortable.
Used in the following competitions:
* SC19 Student Cluster Competition (https://sc19.supercomputing.org/program/studentssc/student-cluster-competition/)
* ISC20 Student Cluster Competition (https://www.isc-hpc.com/student-cluster-competition.html)

Feel free to copy and adapt them to your own needs.
